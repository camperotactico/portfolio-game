## Balance Hero

In this small casual game, the objective is to achieve the highest score by getting different color shapes into the goals at the sides before running out of time.

## About this project

This is a simple video game built using `Unity3D` that I am building to showcase my game development skills using this tool.

The reason why I have decided to create this project is because the last relevant game on my `GitHub` profile was over three years old (right before I started my previous job).

Ever since, my abilities as a developer have improved, and I wanted to build a vertical slice to reflect them, as I am not able to share any of the source code I worked on during my previous employment.

> WIP This document is not finished and is being updated as new features are added.

## Technical features

- **Unit and integration tests**: Key parts of the codebase have been built following test driven development practices, and have been thoroughly tested using the built-in `Unity Test Framework`.
